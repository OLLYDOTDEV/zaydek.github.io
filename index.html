			<b>I believe in excellence in programming.</b>
			I love teaching, and I'm a great communicator.
			I walk towards hard, non-linear problems, and have learned grit.
			I'm both a designer and developer, and I write readable, maintainable Go. <img style="position: relative; top: 0.1rem; height: 1.1rem;" src="images/gopher.gif"><br/>
			<br/>
			I'm excellent in <b>Go</b>, and experienced in <b>Unix</b>, <b>Git</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JS</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>D</b></b>.

			<b>Author</b> at <b>Owl Delivery</b> (10+ months)<br>
			Owl Delivery is a <u>self-architected</u> project to automate the data-collection, backtesting, and trading of financial securities.
			I found I needed to start over time and time again, and learned the meaning of grit.
			I learned how to <u>write, test, and ship microservices</u>, and how to [sometimes] outperform the market.<br>
			<br>
			Example output and documented source code:<br>

			<b>Student</b> at <b>42 Silicon Valley</b> (3 months)<br>
			42 is a new, <u>peer-based</u> computer science bootcamp.
			We learned Unix and C from scratch, and scaled up to <u>recursive, backtracking</u> algorithms.
			Inspired from what I'd learned, I left to write Owl Delivery.
